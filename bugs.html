	<p>Spider at dusk. I took lots of photos of this particular spider, but I love the dusky blue background this one came out with.</p>

	<p>Robberfly eating a fly (please excuse the messy focus). Kael and I watched him catch this fly midair and then scrambled to take pictures. </p>

	<p>Snail climbing some grass. This was one of the first "macro" photographs I ever took, outside of the CAHSS building at CSUMB. </p>

	<p> I really like how this picture turned out. It feels like a moment frozen in time, and of course the colors of the flowers are gorgeous.</p>

	<p>Ladybug larvae aren't the most exciting of subjects, but this turned out to be one of the prettiest photos I've ever taken. The layers of grass provide a really compelling background.</p>

	<p>Genuinely not sure what kind of bug this is (mayfly?). Taken in my grandparents garden. This was my phone background for the longest time.  </p>

	<p>This is the best of what you might call a "series" of photos taken by me and my roommate exploring wolf spiders in their burrows. I'd love to revisit the idea now that I'm more experienced. Still turned out pretty good though! </p>
</div>
			<div>
	<img class= "gallery" src="https://files.catbox.moe/kmdd6y.jpg ">
	<p>I'm always a little dissapointed looking at this one. The background is boring and I managed to miss the right edge of the damselfly, leaving the photo feeling unfinished. Unfortunately the subject turned out so good I have to include it.  </p>

	<img class= "gallery" src="https://files.catbox.moe/7hxp8i.jpg">
	<p>There are other photos of this hoverfly, but despite the poor framing actually seeing a hoverfly hover is too cool to pass up.</p>
</div>
			<div>
	<img class= "gallery" src"https://files.catbox.moe/fcx503.jpg">
	<p>I'm really happy with how this one turned out. Looking at the grains of sand in relation to the spider always blows my mind.</p>
</div>
			<div>
	<img class= "gallery" src="https://files.catbox.moe/7zmb2q.jpg">
	<p>This beetle has an aboslutely gorgeous carapace, I'm obsessed with how clear this one came out.  </p>
</div>

	<img class= "gallery" src="https://files.catbox.moe/l8c5ds.jpg ">
	<p>The flower this fly was on was barely bigger than my thumbnail for scale. The hand looming obelisk-like in the background was to hold the shaky plant still in the wind, but it turned out to be a element I really really loved. </p>
</div>
			<div>
	<img class= "gallery" src="https://files.catbox.moe/vg07fd.jpg ">
	<p>Taken on the same plant as the previous picture, I think this one is almost as good. The blurry of the background makes me think of watercolor somehow. </p>

	<p>These caterpillars are everywhere this time of year. Really vibrant colors in this one. </p>
