Welcome to my blog!
I plan for this to be a general repository of my projects, ideas, and any academic work I'm either doing outside of a class or that I feel particularly proud of. I hope that it not only helps me become a better writer and creator but that someday a work of mine might resonate with some other young person the way so many blogs have resonated with me. 
I mostly write (and think) about mythology, linguistics, the Japanese language, archaeology, and literature in general; so expect posts about those topics. But also, I’m allowed to post about whatever I want. 
I imagine if anyone ever reads this it will be long, long, after it’s first posted. Let’s hope this ages well!
